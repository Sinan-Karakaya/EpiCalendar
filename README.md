# EpiCalendar
A project made with [Lucas Dupont](https://github.com/lucasdpt) to easily get your Epitech's planning as an iCal.

## How to use
Download the extension at the release page of the repo. Once it is installed in your Chromium browser,
open it once you are on the epitech intra page, enter your email, and submit it. The email should
be the one you want the iCal file on.

Once it is done, you can download your iCal file at [this website](https://epicalendar.sinankarakaya.fr).

## Troubleshoot
If you get an error when trying to get your iCal file, you may need to re-submit your email
through the extension. It is possible your cookies are expired on our end.
